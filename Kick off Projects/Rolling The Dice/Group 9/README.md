The code of the roll_the_dice.py file simulates the game Yatzy.
It's a game where you have 3 dices and throw them simultaneously
in the hope that all 3 dices display the same number. When that 
happens, players have to shout "Yatzy!".

If the code of the roll_the_dice.py file simulates the game Ooh No.
It's a game where you have 3 dices and throw them simultaneously in 
the hope that all 3 dices display the same number. Two dices display
same number but 3rd is display another. When that happens, players have
to shout "Ooh No".

We created 3 variables (a, b, c), which represent dices. By using a
random function, these variables will take on a random value. To make
sure that the random value is an integer between 1 and 6, we defined 
the type (int) and created boundaries.

Lastly, we wrote an if statement that checks whether all variables
have the same value. If they do, a message box opens, which
says "Yatzy!". else if statement that checks whether 2 variables
have the same value. If they do, a message box opens, which
says"Ooh No".
