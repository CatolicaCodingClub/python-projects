The code of the guess_a_number.py file simulates a "guess a number game". The computer generates
a random number between 1 and 20. Then the player has to guess what number it is and has 5 tries
to make the right guess. If the player guesses right with not more than 5 tries, he/she wins the game.

For this game to work, 3 variables must be defined. x is a random number generated by the computer.
It is the number the player has to guess to win the game. y is the number guessed by the player. 
He/she has to input the number manually. s is a variable that keeps track on how many tries the 
player has used.
