The sentence_generator.py file generates random sentences. The sentences are generated,
based on randomly selected words. These words are selected from 4 lists. The sentence is
generated by tying one word from each list together into a sentence.

The 4 lists are called FirstWord, SecondWord, ThridWord and ForthWord. In order to select
a random word from each list, the 4 variables a, b, c and d are created. Each variable takes
on a random integer value, which is then used to index a word from the list. Therefore, the
range of random values that each variable can take on, equals the number of words in it's
corresponding list.
