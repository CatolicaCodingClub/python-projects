# Catolica Coding Club - Python projects

This is the Python projects repository of the Catolica Coding Club, a student organization for undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning more about coding. These projects are meant to provide students with some interesting projects to work on in order to apply their knowledge.

## Getting Started

The club organizes events every month (give or take) and suggests multiple projects to the members of the club. 
The members can then present their work at the next event followed by some time for questions and suggestions etc.

### Installing Tools

Getting ready to code is easy but it does require some work to get your Python environment setup properly!
We reccommend to download the following files in order to be able to participate fully.

#### Python Packages and libraries

To save time and avoid fiddling with downloading and installing packages manually downloading Anaconda is a great idea. 
It contains many packages that are useful for data manipulation purposes. 

Alternatively download the latest Python distribution and use a package manager like "Pip" to install the packages you need/want,
this for the more advanced user (or those on limited space).

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) - Recommended!

[Standalone Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)


#### IDE

We recommend installing some kind of IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in order to get some assistance in the form of 
linting, code completion, code suggestions (and more) while coding. Most will also allow you to interact with GitHub for all your
comits, pushing and pulling. There are several options, we list a few popular choices below but feel free to use your own.


[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - A very complete Python IDE, professional version is free to use for a year as a student.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Developped by Microsoft, comes with Anaconda as well, great alternative to PyCharm.


#### Git

To upload files to GitHub easily install Git.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Participating

To get started with coding and by contributing code please take a look at the folder structure inside the repository.
Make sure you upload your files in the right directory following the following format:

```
CatolicaCodingClub/python-projects/<event_x_projects/<project_name>/<Group Name/Number>/<project_code>.py
```
